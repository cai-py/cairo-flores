## Summary 

This project is meant to solve a cleaning issue that arose at my communal house. It uses a kiosk like design to log whenever a community chore is completed. The kiosk interface sends data to an API that I built seperatly and in the future will allow us to, at a glance, see who has been skipping out on chores. 

The system we had before this required residents to write a tally next to their name whenever a chore was completed, this quickly became pointless because someone would've had to spend hours counting these tallies and contacting people about when a chore was not completed. 

In the future I plan to host this on a kiosk like stand in our kitchen using a raspberry pie and some cheap touchscreen display. I would also like to write documentation on how to impliment this project so that it can be available for anyone facing this problem.
