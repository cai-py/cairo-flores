## Summary 

This project was meant to replace my old porfolio to make it easier for me to update whenever I came up with new projects. This project uses Next.js to generate dynamic routes to each of my project. It allows me to generate an entire webpage just by writeing a markdown file for each project. The idea for this came to me when I first started learning next.js for the animal rights group that I volunteer for. The sample project did something similar. 

In the future I plan to add a search ability to it modeled after an assesment project I recived from a company I applied for. This will allow users to search by name and by the specific tech used by each project. This site currently has an expenience page and a blog page, these pages are to be built in the future to allow employers to view a digital resume as well as see what I am working on day to day.
