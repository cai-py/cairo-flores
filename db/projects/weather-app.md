## Summary 

This is a simple weather app that calls an api and diplays the data for your local weather. 

The purpose of this project is to show my ability to work with APIs in next.js. I used a '.env' file to hide environment variables and set them up in Vercel to allow for hosting. 


## Features

- **Current Conditions**: Display the current temperature in Celsius and a brief weather description.
- **Sunrise and Sunset Times**: Show sunrise and sunset times in the user's local time zone.
- **Minimum and Maximum Temperatures**: Provide daily minimum and maximum temperatures.


### Technologies Used

- **React**: The app is built using the React JavaScript library, making it efficient and modular.
- **Geolocation API**: It utilizes the browser's geolocation API to determine the user's location coordinates.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Weather data is fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **CSS**: Custom CSS styles are applied to create an appealing steampunk-themed design.
