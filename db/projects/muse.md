## Summary

This project revisits the idea of one of my pervious projects, [Musique](). This time with a more thoughtout framework

## Struggles 

This project ended up being tossed aside because I could not find a library that could support sheet music file rendering and playing. I contacted a company that I already knew for selling digtal sheet music and allowing it to be played in the web app. They connected me to a library that allowed it but then the struggle of finding a reliable API that had enough sheet music files to make this app useful. I belive musescore used to have a public API like this but it is no longer available for free.
